#Here is where we will give an explanation of each class that we are using and the reason we needed them for our project:

## BNO055
This class is used to we are able to retrieve various orientation-related data from our BNO055 sensor. The BNO055 is an
IMU that we are using so that we are to get data like acceleration, orientation, and angular rates. The BNO055 is a combination 
of an accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyrocosope. Most of the early code of the class are constants that define various register
addresses, modes, and data types for our BNO055 sensor. Th rest of the code is functions that we could possibly use. For example 
there are ways to change which mode the IMU is in. For our project we are using the NDOF mode. There is also a function to calibrate 
our sensor, so that the data we are using is as accurates as can be. The more important function that we used is the getVector
function. This is how we are able to get the data from a ceratin sensor in the IMU. We use this function so that we are able to get
the Euler Angles of our robot and use them the calculate our Yaw. 

## Encoder
This class is actually two classes in one. The first class is used for initiallizing our Encoders. This class is used so that we are able
to keep track of our position, change in position, and velocity. The other class that is in here is our ClosedLoop class. This class is 
used to intialize our closed loop controller with specified proportional, intergral, and derivative gains. Once we have these calculated
we are then able to return a control signal for use to use in our main file.
