Term project for ME405 by Elliott Joseph Bryniarski & Emmanuel Baez

## Project Overview
This years term project is to create a line following robot that is able to follow a given course with multiple obstacles including: dashed lines, hashed lines, rounded corners, and a wall object to go around. Once the robot has gone around the course once it must also attempt to go back to the starting point by any means. The robot must be able to compete on multiple tracks to prevent being hard coded for certain scenarios.
